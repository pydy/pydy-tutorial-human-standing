This equation is actually far too simple for the systems we want to study, but it reveals that there are three topics to consider in describing a rigid body system: its kinematics ($\\v{a}$), its mass properties ($m$), and the external forces applied to the system ($\\v{F}$). In this notebook, we present the tools necessary to mathematically describe a rigid body system. Once equipped with a mathematical description of a system, we can generate equations that describe its motion. Regardless, we always end up with second-order ordinary differential equations in time."
